TurtleTab is a Google Chrome Extension Built with React. It creates a new homepage which features current Weather, Todo and Notes functionality. It also accesses your browser data to see Bookmarks, enable/disable Apps and Extensions, and see/clear your History. It is a collaborative effort by a remote team of aspiring developers who met on Chingu, an international community of coders.
